# MixedRealityPOC

This is our Proof of Concept for the Mixed Reality Course HS2022. In our project, we try to integrate a multi-user functionality to an existing HoloLens app. This Proof-of-Concept is a minimal example, which allows multiple people interact with each other (same as the example described above). We use PUN so that we can see other users interactions and wanted to use Azure spatial anchors so that the coordinates will be shared across all users as well. We followed a Azure Spatial Anchors tutorial to configure the buttons in order to connect the scene to an Azure resource. However, the positions of the anchor were not updated.
